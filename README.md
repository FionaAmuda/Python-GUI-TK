Rock Paper Scissors 
Rock paper scissors is a simple game that uses the random function in python. The computer randomly selects among 3 choices Rock, Paper, or scissors. The player is then prompted to select a choice as well. The next piece of code will compare the two choices and determine the winner. The code has a simple GUI that was designed in tkinter.
